# File Management System with Task Manager

This project is a Java-based system that provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for managing files and processes. Developed using Java Swing, it simulates an operating system environment with features like file and folder operations, process management, and array processing, offering users hands-on experience in system management.

## Features

### File and Folder Management
- **Create Files and Folders**: Allows users to create files and folders dynamically.
- **Rename Files**: Facilitates file renaming for better organization.
- **Search Functionality**: Implements recursive file search within directories.
- **Delete Files and Folders**: Enables users to delete files and folders with ease.

### Process Management (Task Manager)
- **Run Processes**: Initiates processes with unique IDs for operations like summation and sorting.
- **Process Monitoring**: Displays a list of active processes.
- **Terminate Processes**: Provides the ability to kill processes by ID.
- **Array Processing**: Supports summation and sorting (ascending/descending) of array elements.

### User-Friendly Interface
- Designed using Java Swing components for simplicity and accessibility.
- Clear organization of functionalities across the File Management System and Task Manager windows.

## Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Java Programming Language**: Core language for logic implementation.
- **Java Swing Library**: Used to design the graphical user interface.
- **java.nio.file Package**: Ensures efficient file handling.

## Usage

1. **File Management**:
   - Create, rename, search, and delete files or folders using dedicated buttons.
   - Navigate between the file management window and task manager.

2. **Task Manager**:
   - Run array processes (e.g., summation, sorting).
   - Monitor active processes and terminate them as required.

## Outputs
- User-friendly prompts guide users through each action.
- Detailed feedback on operation success or failure ensures clarity.
